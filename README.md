<p>
  The Arduino Wi-Fi Controlled Car with Camera is a project that combines Arduino, Wi-Fi connectivity, and a camera to create a remote-controlled car. The car can be controlled using a mobile application, which also provides a live video feed from the car's camera. Additionally, the Arduino car has the ability to recognize faces, although this feature may be unstable due to memory limitations.
</p>
<p>NOTE: this was a semester project and is not being actively maintained. </p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Remote Control: Use a mobile application to wirelessly control the Arduino car's movement.</li>
  <li>Live Video Feed: Stream a real-time video feed from the car's camera to the web application for monitoring and navigation.</li>
  <li>Face Recognition (Experimental): The Arduino car is equipped with face recognition capabilities, allowing it to detect and identify faces. Please note that this feature may be unstable due to memory limitations.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Installation</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Clone the repository: <code>git clone https://github.com/your-username/arduino-wifi-car.git</code></li>
  <li>Upload the Arduino code to your Arduino board using the Arduino IDE.</li>
  <li>Set up the Wi-Fi connection between the Arduino board and the mobile application. (you must use same wifi connection. Use hotspots for ease)</li>
  <li>Install the web application on your smartphone running on localhost.</li>
  <li>Launch the localhost application and establish a connection with the Arduino car.</li>
</ol>


<h2>Usage</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Power on the Arduino car and ensure it is connected to the Wi-Fi network.</li>
  <li>Launch the web application on your smartphone.</li>
  <li>Establish a connection with the Arduino car through the mobile application.</li>
  <li>Use the on-screen controls in the mobile application to drive the car and view the live video feed from the camera.</li>
  <li>(Experimental) Enable the face recognition feature and observe the Arduino car's ability to detect and recognize faces. Please note that this feature may be unstable due to memory limitations.</li>
</ol>
